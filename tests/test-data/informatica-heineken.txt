Company: Informatica
Customer: Heineken (Global Brewing Company)
Meeting Date: November 13, 2024
Attendees: Lars Van Der Berg (VP Data & Analytics EMEA), Maria Santos (Head of Supply Chain Data), James Mitchell (Enterprise Architect)

Topic: Real-Time Data Integration for Global Supply Chain Optimization

CUSTOMER PROFILE:
- Heineken operates 160+ breweries across 70 countries
- 300+ beer brands, 85,000 employees
- Current data architecture: 50+ disparate systems (SAP, Oracle, custom brewery systems, IoT sensors)
- Data latency: 24-48 hours (batch ETL) causing operational blindspots
- Annual revenue: $30B, supply chain costs: $12B (40% of revenue)

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Maria's Supply Chain Challenge:
"We brew 25 billion liters of beer annually. When a brewery in Spain has a quality issue, we don't know until the next day. By then, 500,000 bottles are already bottled and shipped. Real-time visibility could save us $50M annually in waste and recalls alone."

Lars' Data Strategy:
"We have 2,400 data sources. Our data engineers spend 60% of time on plumbing - moving data between systems - instead of building analytics. We need to democratize data access for 800+ data consumers (analysts, scientists, business users) without overwhelming our 45-person data team."

IT LANDSCAPE PAIN POINTS:
1. Brewery Production Data:
   - 160 breweries each with different IoT sensors (Siemens, Rockwell, Schneider Electric)
   - Data formats: OPC-UA, MQTT, Modbus, CSV exports
   - Current ETL: nightly batch jobs via custom Python scripts (15K lines of code to maintain)
   - Downtime costs: $50K per hour per brewery
   - Need: Real-time quality metrics (pH, temperature, fermentation rate) to predict issues

2. Supply Chain Visibility:
   - 3PL partners send shipment data via EDI (X12, EDIFACT), API, email (yes, email!)
   - Inventory data scattered: SAP ERP (12 instances), Oracle WMS, custom systems
   - Current state: Finance team manually reconciles in Excel (6 people, 40 hours/week)
   - Business impact: $200M in excess inventory due to lack of real-time visibility

3. Regulatory Compliance:
   - GDPR, CCPA, local food safety regulations across 70 countries
   - Data lineage requirements - must prove data origin for audits
   - Current approach: manual documentation (300-page spreadsheets)
   - Audit prep time: 3 months, risk of €20M fines for non-compliance

INFORMATICA SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE:

Real-Time Data Integration Platform:
1. Intelligent Data Integration (IICS + CDI)
   - Connect all 2,400 sources via 200+ pre-built connectors
   - Change Data Capture (CDC) from SAP, Oracle for real-time sync
   - REST API endpoints for IoT sensor streams
   - Parse & normalize EDI formats from 3PL partners

2. Data Quality & Master Data Management
   - CLAIRE AI engine detects anomalies in brewery sensor data
   - Automated data quality rules: flag pH outside 4.0-4.5 range, temp >28°C
   - Master data for products, locations, suppliers across all systems
   - Self-service data preparation for analysts (no IT required)

3. Cloud Data Lakehouse (Snowflake Integration)
   - Real-time streaming from sources → Snowflake
   - Unified data model: raw, curated, consumption layers
   - Data catalog with CLAIRE AI auto-classification (PII, financial, operational)
   - Governance: policy-based access control, automated data masking for GDPR

USE CASES TO DEMONSTRATE:

Use Case 1: Predictive Brewing Quality (THE HERO USE CASE)
Problem: Brewery in Spain had bacterial contamination, 500K bottles recalled, $2M loss
Solution:
- IoT sensors stream pH, temp, yeast activity to Informatica Cloud → Snowflake every 30 seconds
- CLAIRE AI detects anomaly: pH trending down 6 hours before critical threshold
- Automated alert to brewmaster via MS Teams
- Brewmaster adjusts process, avoids contamination
- Impact: $50M annual savings (25 prevented recalls/year)

Use Case 2: Real-Time Inventory Optimization
Problem: $200M excess inventory, $30M stockouts due to 48-hour data lag
Solution:
- CDC from 12 SAP instances + Oracle WMS → unified inventory view in Snowflake
- Real-time dashboard: inventory levels, in-transit shipments, demand forecasts
- Automated replenishment triggers when stock <7 days
- Impact: Reduce inventory by 15% ($30M working capital freed), eliminate 80% stockouts

Use Case 3: Automated Compliance Reporting
Problem: 3 months to prepare for audit, risk of fines
Solution:
- Data lineage tracked automatically for all data flows
- Pre-built compliance templates: GDPR data subject access requests in <24 hours
- Automated PII discovery & classification across all datasets
- Impact: Audit prep time 3 months → 2 weeks, zero compliance violations

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE:
vs Talend (current vendor):
- Talend: on-premise, manual coding, limited connectors
- Informatica: cloud-native, CLAIRE AI auto-mapping, 200+ connectors
- Performance: Informatica processes 10M rows/min vs Talend 2M rows/min (5x faster)

vs Fivetran/Matillion:
- They only do ELT (load then transform), we do real-time CDC and data quality
- No AI-powered data discovery or governance
- Limited enterprise support (we have 24/7 dedicated CSM)

vs Building Custom (their current approach):
- 15K lines of Python code to maintain = 4 FTEs
- Every new source takes 3-4 weeks to onboard
- Informatica: drag-and-drop designer, new sources in hours, no code maintenance

BUSINESS VALUE PROPOSITION:
Investment: $800K annually (platform license + professional services)
ROI Year 1:
- Brewery quality savings: $50M (prevented recalls)
- Inventory optimization: $30M (working capital + stockout reduction)
- Data engineer productivity: $2M (60% time freed = 27 FTEs → focus on analytics)
- Compliance risk mitigation: $20M (avoid potential fines)
Total value: $102M
Net ROI: $101.2M / $800K = 12,650% ROI

Time to Value: 90 days to first production use case

OBJECTION HANDLING:
"Too expensive compared to Fivetran"
→ Fivetran = $500K/year but only does 20% of what we need. You'd still need data quality tool ($200K), MDM ($300K), governance ($150K) = $1.15M total. We're all-in-one at $800K.

"We have Talend, why switch?"
→ Your team spends 60% time on maintenance. That's $2M in wasted labor annually. Our CLAIRE AI auto-maintains mappings. Plus, Talend can't do real-time CDC at scale.

"Cloud security concerns for brewing IP"
→ Data encrypted at rest & in transit (AES-256). Private cloud deployment option. You control data residency (keep EU data in EU). SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001 certified.

PROOF OF CONCEPT PLAN:
Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Connect Spain brewery IoT sensors
Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Build predictive quality dashboard
Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Integrate SAP ERP for one region
Success Criteria:
- <30 second latency for sensor data
- Detect 3 quality anomalies in testing
- Zero data loss (100% reliability)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Technical deep dive with James' team: Nov 20
