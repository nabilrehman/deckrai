Company: Salesforce
Customer: Wells Fargo Private Wealth Management
Meeting Date: November 12, 2024
Attendees: Tom Harrison (SVP Wealth Management Technology), Rachel Kim (Managing Director - Advisor Experience), David Chen (Head of Compliance & Risk)

Topic: Financial Services Cloud for Advisor Productivity & Client Experience

ACCOUNT BACKGROUND:
- Wells Fargo Wealth Management: 3,200 financial advisors, $1.9 trillion AUM
- Current tech stack: homegrown CRM from 2009, Salesforce Sales Cloud (basic), Envestnet for portfolio management
- Advisor productivity issues: spending 3 hours/day on admin tasks instead of client conversations
- Client retention: 87% (industry avg: 92%) - losing $200M AUM annually to competitors with better digital experience
- Regulatory pressure: SEC exam found gaps in client communication documentation

BUSINESS DRIVERS:
Tom's Technology Mandate:
"We're getting crushed by Morgan Stanley and Schwab on advisor tools. Our advisors are threatening to leave. I've lost 47 top producers in the last 18 months - that's $12B in AUM walking out the door. We need to modernize NOW or we're dead in 5 years."

Rachel's Advisor Pain Points:
"Our advisors are drowning. They manage 120-150 client relationships each but can only meet with 20-30 clients per quarter because of all the data entry. Every client meeting requires 90 minutes of prep time pulling data from 8 different systems. It's insane. Schwab advisors can prep in 15 minutes with a unified view."

David's Compliance Nightmares:
"The SEC just fined us $35M for inadequate client communication records. Our current system doesn't track every email, call, meeting note in one place. Advisors are using personal Gmail, WhatsApp, texting clients - it's a compliance disaster waiting to happen. We need an audit trail for EVERY client interaction."

CURRENT STATE PAIN POINTS:

1. Fragmented Client Data (8 Systems!):
   - Core banking: Mainframe system (1980s vintage)
   - CRM: Legacy homegrown tool (no mobile, crashes daily)
   - Portfolio management: Envestnet
   - Financial planning: MoneyGuidePro
   - Document management: SharePoint (10M files, impossible to find anything)
   - Communication: Email (Outlook), phone logs (manual entry), meeting notes (Word docs scattered across drives)
   - Compliance: Smarsh for email archiving (disconnected from CRM)
   - Analytics: Tableau dashboards (2-day data lag)

2. Advisor Productivity Crisis:
   - Average day: 3 hours on admin (data entry, finding info), 5 hours on client work
   - Client onboarding: 45 days (industry best: 7 days at Morgan Stanley)
   - Opportunity pipeline visibility: ZERO - advisors keep prospects in Excel
   - Cross-sell rate: 1.2 products per client (should be 3-4)
   - New client acquisition: 8 per advisor per year (goal: 20)

3. Client Experience Gaps:
   - No mobile app (clients can't see portfolio 24/7)
   - Email is primary communication (clients want text, WhatsApp, video)
   - Quarterly review prep: advisors manually create PowerPoint decks (6 hours each)
   - Client portal: outdated, clients complain it looks like 1999
   - Referral tracking: non-existent (losing warm leads)

4. Compliance & Risk Exposure:
   - SEC exam findings: 23 violations related to inadequate supervision
   - Missing client communication records (can't prove conversations happened)
   - No automated supervision workflows (managers can't review advisor activities)
   - Trade surveillance gaps (market abuse risk)
   - FINRA fines: $8M in last 2 years

- Automated outreach: personalized email with tax projection calculator
- Tracking: open rates, clicks, meeting bookings
- Pipeline: 89 booked meetings, 34 conversions = $67M in conversions
- Previous campaign (manual): 2 months to execute, 12 conversions
- FSC campaign: 2 weeks, 34 conversions (3x better)

PLATFORM CAPABILITIES HIGHLIGHT:
1. Financial Services Cloud:
   - Pre-built objects: Client, Household, Accounts, Portfolios, Financial Goals, Referrals
   - Relationship mapping (family trees, decision makers, influencers)
   - Life events tracking (marriage, baby, job change → trigger reviews)
   - Action plans for goals (retirement, college, estate planning)

   - Secure messaging with advisor
   - Document upload (tax returns, estate docs)
   - Appointment scheduling
   - Financial planning tools (retirement calculator, Monte Carlo simulations)

COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION:
vs Wealthbox (current consideration):
- Wealthbox: basic CRM ($50/user/mo), no AI, no compliance features
- Salesforce FSC: full platform ($300/user/mo), Einstein AI, Data Cloud, compliance built-in
- Wealthbox integration nightmare (they'd still need 8 systems)

vs Redtail CRM:
- Built for RIAs (small firms), not enterprise scale (3,200 advisors)
- No AI capabilities
- Limited mobile experience
- No Data Cloud for real-time integration

vs Microsoft Dynamics:
- Not industry-specific (would require 2 years of customization)
- No financial services compliance features
- Weaker AI (Copilot is generic, not wealth management trained)

BUSINESS CASE:
Investment: $12M annually
- FSC licenses: 3,200 users x $300/mo = $11.5M
- Professional services (implementation): $5M one-time
- Total 3-year TCO: $41M

ROI Drivers:
- Advisor retention: Prevent 47 advisors leaving = $12B AUM saved = $48M revenue (0.4% fee)
- Productivity gain: 3 hours/day saved x 3,200 advisors = 9,600 hours/day = 240 FTE equivalents = $36M annually
- Compliance fine reduction: Avoid $35M fines (prevent SEC violations)
- Client retention: Improve from 87% → 92% = $200M AUM retention = $800K revenue
- Cross-sell increase: 1.2 → 2.5 products per client = 4,160 new product sales = $25M revenue

Total Value: $144M annually
Net ROI: ($144M - $12M) x 3 years - $5M = $391M over 3 years
ROI: 854%

Time to Value: 6 months to first advisor cohort live

OBJECTIONS ADDRESSED:
"$12M/year is expensive"
→ You're losing $48M in revenue from advisor attrition alone. This pays for itself 4x over. Plus, the SEC just fined you $35M - compliance is not optional.

"Our IT team is maxed out"
→ Salesforce is SaaS - no servers to manage. Implementation by our Professional Services team + Deloitte (your existing SI partner). Your IT team reviews security, doesn't build.

"Advisors hate change, they won't adopt"
→ 87% of wealth advisors rank "better technology" as #1 reason they'd switch firms (Schwab study). Your advisors are ASKING for this. Change management program included: training, champions program, executive sponsorship.

"Data security concerns"
→ Bank-grade encryption (AES-256), SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, FINRA/SEC compliant. 9 of top 10 US banks use Salesforce. Wells Fargo already uses Sales Cloud (security approved). FSC uses same infrastructure.

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Foundation
- Data Cloud integration: connect all 8 systems
- Migrate 1.9T client records
- Configure FSC: accounts, households, portfolios
- Build compliance workflows

Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Pilot
- 200 advisors (top performers, early adopters)
- Full training program (3 days in-person + ongoing virtual)

- Decommission legacy CRM
- Stabilization & optimization

Phase 4 (Months 13-18): Advanced Features
- Einstein AI insights

EXECUTIVE ALIGNMENT:
- Tom (SVP Tech): Budget owner ($50M IT budget), reports to CIO, highly motivated (bonus tied to advisor retention)
- Rachel (Managing Director): Business sponsor, represents 3,200 advisors, has CEO's ear
- David (Compliance): Risk mitigator, board reports quarterly on compliance, SEC exam in 6 months

DEAL STRATEGY:
- Executive Briefing with CIO & Chief Risk Officer: Nov 25
- POC with 20 advisors (NY office): Dec 2024
- Board presentation (Tom + Rachel): Jan 2025
- Contract signature: Feb 2025
- Kickoff: March 2025
- Go-live Phase 1: September 2025

COMPETITIVE THREATS:
- Wealthbox: cheap, but advisor feedback is "you get what you pay for"
- Microsoft: in discussion but IT team pushing back (integration concerns)
- Internal: "let's keep building in-house" (already failed, 5 years and $20M spent)
