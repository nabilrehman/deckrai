Company: Microsoft
Customer: Contoso Manufacturing
Meeting Date: Nov 2024
Attendees: Sarah Chen (CTO), Mike Rodriguez (Head of IT), Jennifer Park (Business Process Manager)

Topic: Azure Logic Apps for Enterprise Integration

DISCOVERY NOTES:
- Currently using 15+ different systems: SAP ERP, Salesforce CRM, ServiceNow, legacy AS/400, custom inventory system
- Manual data entry between systems costing 200+ hours/month
- Order processing takes 3-5 days due to system silos
- Failed integration attempts with MuleSoft (too complex, project stalled after 6 months)
- IT team is only 8 people - need low-code solution
- Budget approved: $250K annually for integration platform

PAIN POINTS:
1. Order-to-Cash Process:
   - Sales rep enters order in Salesforce
   - Finance manually re-enters into SAP for invoicing
   - Warehouse gets email notification, manually updates inventory system
   - Average 47 manual touchpoints per order
   - 12% error rate causing customer complaints

2. IT Ticket Workflow:
   - ServiceNow tickets not syncing with internal systems
   - Engineers waste 30 mins/day checking multiple dashboards
   - SLA breaches due to delayed notifications

3. Supply Chain Visibility:
   - Real-time inventory data not available
   - Weekly batch updates from suppliers
   - Overstocking costs $2M/year, stockouts losing $500K in sales

SOLUTION DEMO:
Logic Apps Use Cases to Present:
1. Automated Order Processing Flow
   - Salesforce opportunity closed → Logic App triggers
   - Validate customer credit in SAP
   - Create sales order in SAP automatically
   - Send confirmation email via SendGrid
   - Update inventory reservations
   - Notify warehouse via Teams webhook
   - Reduced processing time: 3 days → 2 hours

2. IT Operations Automation
   - ServiceNow ticket created → Logic App monitors
   - Severity 1 tickets auto-escalate in Teams
   - Pull related data from monitoring tools (Datadog, Azure Monitor)
   - Create unified incident dashboard in Power BI
   - Engineers save 2 hours/day

3. Supply Chain Integration
   - Real-time supplier EDI feeds → Logic Apps ingestion
   - Parse XML/JSON from 12 different suppliers
   - Normalize data formats
   - Update central inventory database
   - Trigger reorder workflows when stock < threshold
   - Send daily summary reports

COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION:
vs MuleSoft:
- Logic Apps: $0.000025/action vs MuleSoft $75K base license
- Visual designer - no coding required (Jennifer's team can build)
- Built-in Azure connectors (they're already using Azure VM, Storage, SQL)

vs Workato:
- Native Microsoft ecosystem integration (Teams, Dynamics 365, Power Platform)
- Enterprise-grade security with Azure AD, compliance certifications
- Managed service - no infrastructure to maintain

KEY METRICS TO EMPHASIZE:
- 200+ pre-built connectors including SAP, Salesforce, ServiceNow
- 99.9% SLA uptime guarantee
- 47 manual steps → 0 manual steps (100% automation)
- ROI: $250K investment saves $850K/year (labor + error reduction + inventory optimization)
- Implementation timeline: 6-8 weeks vs 6+ months for MuleSoft

OBJECTION HANDLING:
"We tried integration before and it failed"
→ MuleSoft requires Java developers, Logic Apps uses visual designer. Jennifer's business analysts can build workflows with 2-day training.

"What about vendor lock-in?"
→ Open standards (REST, SOAP, EDI), can export workflow definitions, hybrid cloud support

"Security concerns with cloud?"
→ SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA compliant. Data stays in Azure (already using), private endpoints, managed identities

NEXT STEPS:
1. 2-week POC: Build Salesforce-to-SAP order flow
2. Success criteria: Process 100 test orders with <1% error rate
3. Training sessions for Jennifer's team (3x 4-hour workshops)
4. Pilot go-live: Dec 15, 2024
5. Full rollout: Q1 2025

CHAMPIONS:
- Jennifer (Business Process Manager): Excited about low-code, wants to reduce dependency on IT
- Mike (Head of IT): Loves managed service model, team is stretched thin
- Sarah (CTO): Focused on ROI, needs quick wins to justify budget

DECISION TIMELINE:
- Verbal commitment by Dec 1
- Contract signed by Dec 15
- POC starts Jan 2, 2025
