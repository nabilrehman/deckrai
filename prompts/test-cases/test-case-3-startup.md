# Test Case 3: CloudSync (Fictional Startup - Limited Brand Assets)

## Test Parameters

**Company Name:** CloudSync (fictional SaaS startup - does not exist)

**Content/Narrative:**
Series A investor pitch deck for CloudSync, a B2B SaaS platform that syncs data across multiple cloud storage providers (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box) in real-time. The deck should present:
- The problem: Enterprises use average 4.2 cloud storage providers, data is scattered and out of sync
- The market opportunity: $8.5B total addressable market, growing 23% annually
- The solution: CloudSync's real-time bi-directional sync with conflict resolution
- The traction: 450 beta customers, $250K ARR, 15% month-over-month growth
- The product: Demo screenshots, architecture diagram, key features
- The business model: Pricing tiers, unit economics, CAC/LTV ratios
- The team: Founders (2x ex-Dropbox engineers, 1x enterprise sales leader)
- The ask: $8M Series A at $32M post-money valuation

**Target Audience:** Venture capital investors (Series A stage)

**Presentation Goal:** Secure $8M Series A funding, demonstrate market opportunity, prove product-market fit, showcase team competence, justify valuation

**Desired Slide Count:** 15 slides (standard VC pitch deck length)

## Test Challenge

This test evaluates the prompt's ability to:
- **Handle non-existent companies** (no real brand to research)
- **Make intelligent assumptions** based on industry and audience
- **Create appropriate brand system** from scratch
- **Document assumptions clearly**

Since CloudSync doesn't exist, the prompt should:
1. Acknowledge limited brand information
2. Research competitor brands (Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, etc.) for industry norms
3. Create a brand-appropriate design system for a SaaS startup
4. Document all assumptions with rationale
5. Use modern SaaS design conventions

---

## Expected Quality Baseline

### Brand Research Quality (10 points)
- Clearly states "CloudSync is fictional - no brand assets found"
- Researches competitor/industry design norms (Dropbox, etc.)
- Creates appropriate SaaS startup aesthetic:
  - Modern blues, greens, or teals (trust, technology)
  - Clean sans-serif typography (Inter, Poppins, Roboto)
  - Modern, minimal, data-driven style
  - Professional but not stuffy (startup energy)
- Documents assumptions: "Since CloudSync is a B2B SaaS startup targeting enterprises, using: Blue #1E88E5 for trust and technology, white backgrounds for clarity, etc."

### Visual Hierarchy Clarity (10 points)
- Investor deck hierarchy (different from sales or marketing decks)
- Data-first focal points (metrics, charts, traction numbers)
- Slide-specific hierarchy for pitch deck format:
  - Problem slide: Pain point dominates
  - Market slide: TAM number dominates
  - Traction slide: Growth chart dominates
  - Team slide: Credentials dominate

### Architecture Detail (10 points)
- VC pitch deck conventions followed:
  - Company logo top left
  - Slide numbers bottom right
  - Clean, scannable layouts (VCs see 100s of decks)
  - Data visualization standards
- All measurements and specs provided

### Specifications Completeness (10 points)
- Complete brand system created from scratch
- All hex codes, fonts, sizes specified
- Design choices justified with reasoning
- Competitor research documented

### Design System Quality (10 points)
- Cohesive brand created for fictional company
- Industry-appropriate aesthetic
- Investor-appropriate tone (professional, data-driven, credible)
- Startup energy balanced with enterprise credibility

## Success Criteria

**Minimum Passing Score:** 45/50 (90%)

**Specific Checks:**
- [ ] Prompt recognizes CloudSync doesn't exist
- [ ] Assumptions are clearly documented
- [ ] Competitor research conducted (Dropbox, Box, etc.)
- [ ] Appropriate SaaS brand system created (blue/teal/green, modern sans-serif)
- [ ] VC pitch deck conventions followed (standard 15-slide format)
- [ ] Data-driven visual hierarchy (metrics dominate)
- [ ] Professional yet startup-appropriate aesthetic
- [ ] All design choices have rationale
- [ ] Complete design system provided despite no real brand
- [ ] Designer could execute the deck based on specs

---

## Expected Assumptions

The prompt should make these or similar assumptions:

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Blue (#1E88E5 or similar) - Technology, trust, common in SaaS
- Accent: Green (#00C853 or similar) - Growth, success, positive metrics
- Neutral: Dark gray (#212121), light gray (#F5F5F5), white (#FFFFFF)
- Rationale: "Blue is standard for B2B SaaS (trust + technology), green accent for traction/growth metrics"

**Typography:**
- Primary: Inter, Poppins, or Roboto - Modern, clean, widely available
- Rationale: "Modern sans-serif appropriate for tech startup, excellent screen readability"

**Visual Style:**
- Clean, minimal, data-focused
- Modern SaaS aesthetic (not playful, not corporate)
- Charts and metrics prominent
- Screenshot mockups for product slides
- Rationale: "VC pitch requires credibility and clarity, data must be instantly scannable"

**Logo Assumptions:**
- Since no logo exists, describe placeholder: "CloudSync logo (assume: blue cloud icon + modern sans-serif wordmark, positioned top-left, 120px wide)"

---

## Additional Evaluation Criteria

**Assumption Quality:**
- Are assumptions reasonable and well-justified?
- Are industry norms researched and applied?
- Is reasoning transparent?

**Adaptability:**
- Can prompt create a cohesive brand from nothing?
- Does it maintain quality without real brand assets?
- Does it follow pitch deck conventions?

**Documentation:**
- Are assumptions clearly marked as assumptions?
- Is rationale provided for each design choice?
- Would a designer understand why choices were made?

## Test Execution Notes

1. Run the prompt with Thinking Budget: 16384
2. Review thinking output - should show reasoning about:
   - "CloudSync not found in brand databases"
   - "Researching competitor aesthetics (Dropbox, Box)"
   - "Creating brand system based on B2B SaaS norms"
3. Verify assumptions are documented with "ASSUMPTION:" labels
4. Check if created brand feels cohesive despite being fictional
5. Verify pitch deck conventions are followed
6. Score against rubric
7. Document how well prompt handled missing brand info

## Success Indicators

**Excellent (48-50/50):**
- Prompt seamlessly creates professional brand system
- Assumptions are sophisticated and well-researched
- Output indistinguishable from real company spec
- All design choices justified with industry knowledge

**Good (45-47/50):**
- Assumptions are reasonable and documented
- Created brand is cohesive
- Some design choices need more justification
- Overall quality high despite missing brand

**Needs Improvement (<45/50):**
- Assumptions are vague or poorly justified
- Created brand feels generic or inconsistent
- Design choices not explained
- Output quality lower without real brand to reference
