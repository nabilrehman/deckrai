## THINKING OUTPUT

**Here's how I'm thinking about this task, and the process I'll use to approach it.**

My main focus is on creating an incredibly detailed, designer-ready specification for an Atlassian presentation, focusing on a customer success story for "TechCorp Inc.". I know Atlassian has a well-defined public design system, and I'll leverage this heavily. I see this as a multi-stage project, starting with deconstruction and strategic planning, followed by thorough research, building a content architecture, and finally, diving deep into detailed slide specifications.

Firstly, I'll take time to *understand the user's needs*.  They need a template with visual hierarchy and extreme specificity, so that's the mindset I'll be in. Since it's Atlassian, I'll *immediately* begin researching their design guidelines (which I know will have tons of publicly accessible data). I'll also map out the presentation's story, which will be "Problem -> Solution -> Process -> Results -> Lessons". I've got to find the right balance of data-driven and aspirational in my visuals. I'll shoot for a 13-slide structure.

After that, I'll take a deep dive into the Atlassian brand, finding their official design system page, color codes, and fonts. I'll craft a content architecture, laying out each of the 13 slides in detail, sketching out my ideas as I go. Then comes the real nitty-gritty: the detailed slide specs. I'll meticulously define every element on each slide—hierarchy, typography, layout, color, and spacing, with specific `px` values. It's about making sure it's *clear, and easy to build for a designer*. I'm thinking about "what's the most important thing on the slide", and build around that, keeping everything clean and consistent with the brand.

To solidify everything, I'll put together a thorough design system and production notes. The design system will become my reusable guide for colors, typography, and layout, and the production notes will outline everything the designer needs to execute the slides. By following this meticulous process, I’ll ensure every requirement of the prompt is met. I'll then perform a comprehensive review to check all the criteria before delivering the final document. The focus will be on delivering a comprehensive, professional, and actionable design specification.

-   **Whitespace Strategy:** Generous. ~60% of the slide is empty space, creating a clean, confident opening.

---

---

**🧠 DESIGN RATIONALE**

**Why This Hierarchy:** The logo lockup is primary to instantly establish the partnership. The headline is secondary but large, delivering the key outcome upfront to hook the audience. This creates intrigue and sets the stage effectively.
**Why This Architecture:** A centered, symmetric layout conveys stability, confidence, and focus. The deep blue background is professional and aligns with the Atlassian brand, while the vast whitespace prevents the slide from feeling cluttered.
**Expected Viewer Experience:** Viewer feels they are about to see a professional, high-value case study. They should immediately understand the key players (TechCorp, Atlassian) and the core achievement (40% faster delivery).

---

### SLIDE 2: THE CHALLENGE

**Headline:** Work was scattered. Progress was slow.
**Subhead:** TechCorp's teams were disconnected and misaligned.

---

**🎯 VISUAL HIERARCHY & ARCHITECTURE**

**Information Density:** Low
**Visual Approach:** Story
**Eye Flow Pattern:** Z-pattern. Eye starts at the top left headline, moves across to the right side of the illustration, then down to the subhead.

**Visual Weight Distribution:**
1.  **PRIMARY (70%):** A stylized, abstract illustration depicting chaos and disconnection. Think tangled lines, separate floating blocks, and frustrated character icons.
2.  **SECONDARY (20%):** The main headline, clearly stating the problem.
3.  **TERTIARY (10%):** The subhead and slide number.

**Focal Point Strategy:**
-   **First Eye Contact:** The chaotic illustration, which emotionally conveys the problem before the text is even read.
-   **Visual Path:** Center-right of illustration → Headline (top-left) → Subhead (below headline).
-   **Retention Element:** The feeling of "disconnection" and "chaos."

**Layout Architecture:**
-   **Grid Structure:** Asymmetric 2-column layout (40% text, 60% visual).
-   **Balance Type:** Asymmetric 40/60.
-   **Anchor Element:** The illustration on the right side of the slide.
-   **Whitespace Strategy:** Concentrated on the left side, providing breathing room for the text. ~30% whitespace.

---

**📐 DETAILED VISUAL DESIGN**

**Background:**
-   **Color:** #FFFFFF.

**Primary Visual Element:**
-   **Type:** Illustration.
-   **Position:** Occupies the right 60% of the slide.
-   **Size:** Approx. 1150px wide by 800px high.
-   **Style:** Atlassian's friendly, flat illustration style. Use simple geometric shapes and characters.
-   **Colors:** Use a muted palette with the Accent Red (#DE350B) for tangled lines to signify problems. Neutrals like #5E6C84 and a desaturated blue.
-   **Relationship to Text:** Sits distinctly to the right of the text block, separated by a clean gutter.

---

**📝 TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY**

**Headline:**
-   **Font:** Charlie Sans, Bold (700).
-   **Size:** 54pt.
-   **Color:** #172B4D (Neutral Dark).
-   **Position:** Top left, aligned with the left margin.
-   **Alignment:** Left.
-   **Visual Weight:** 20%.

**Subhead:**
-   **Font:** Charlie Sans, Regular (400).
-   **Size:** 24pt.
-   **Color:** #5E6C84 (Neutral Medium).
-   **Position:** Below headline, left-aligned.
-   **Alignment:** Left.
-   **Line Height:** 1.4.
-   **Visual Weight:** 8%.

---

**🎨 COLOR & CONTRAST HIERARCHY**

**Color Palette for This Slide:**
-   **Dominant Color:** #FFFFFF (Background).
-   **Accent Color:** #DE350B (Red) - Used sparingly in the illustration for negative emphasis.
-   **Supporting Color:** #5E6C84 (Neutral Medium) - For illustration elements.
-   **Text Color:** #172B4D.

**Contrast Strategy:**
-   **Highest Contrast Element:** The dark text against the white background (Ratio > 12:1).
-   **Medium Contrast:** The red accent color within the illustration draws attention to the "problem areas."

---

**🧠 DESIGN RATIONALE**

**Why This Hierarchy:** The illustration is primary because showing the problem is more impactful than telling. The headline provides the rational frame for the emotional visual.
**Why This Architecture:** The asymmetric layout creates a dynamic feel, contrasting the static, stuck nature of the problem being described. It separates the problem (visual) from its description (text) for clarity.
**Expected Viewer Experience:** The viewer should immediately relate to the feeling of chaos and recognize the pain points of disconnected teams, making them receptive to the solution.

---

### SLIDE 3: BEFORE: A PATCHWORK OF TOOLS

**Headline:** Every Team, A Different Tool
**Subhead:** Communication lived in emails, plans in spreadsheets, and code in isolated repos.

---

**🎯 VISUAL HIERARCHY & ARCHITECTURE**

**Information Density:** Medium
**Visual Approach:** Comparison / Grid
**Eye Flow Pattern:** F-pattern. The viewer reads the headline, then scans down the list of cards, reading the icon and then the text for each.

**Visual Weight Distribution:**
1.  **PRIMARY (60%):** A grid of 3-4 "cards," each representing a siloed tool (email, spreadsheets, etc.) with a generic icon and a problem statement.
2.  **SECONDARY (30%):** The main headline and subhead.
3.  **TERTIARY (10%):** Decorative elements, background texture.

**Focal Point Strategy:**
-   **First Eye Contact:** The grid of cards as a whole unit, which conveys the idea of "many separate things."
-   **Visual Path:** Headline → First Card (Icon then Text) → Second Card → Third Card.
-   **Retention Element:** The concept of "silos" and "fragmentation."

**Layout Architecture:**
-   **Grid Structure:** A 2x2 or 3x1 grid of content cards below the main headline.
-   **Balance Type:** Symmetric. The centered headline block sits atop a balanced grid.
-   **Anchor Element:** The block of cards.
-   **Whitespace Strategy:** Consistent gutters between cards and ample margin around the entire content block. ~40% whitespace.

---

**📐 DETAILED VISUAL DESIGN**

**Background:**
-   **Color:** #F4F5F7 (Neutral Light).

**Primary Visual Element:**
-   **Type:** Content Cards.
-   **Position:** Arranged in a grid in the center of the slide, below the header.
-   **Card Style:** White (#FFFFFF) cards with a subtle drop shadow (Y: 2px, Blur: 8px, Color: rgba(23, 43, 77, 0.1)). 16px corner radius.
-   **Card Content:**
    -   **Icon:** A large (64px) icon at the top of each card in Neutral Medium (#5E6C84). e.g., an envelope icon for "Email," a grid icon for "Spreadsheets."

    -   **Description:** A one-line description of the problem. (Charlie Sans Regular 400, 16pt, #5E6C84).
