## THINKING OUTPUT

**Okay, here's the game plan for this Atlassian presentation foundation. I'm going to take a very structured, methodical approach, keeping the user's expertise in mind.  It's all about providing clear, actionable instructions for a team to execute a visually compelling presentation.**

First, I'm diving deep into Atlassian's brand, making sure I know their design guidelines, color palette, and tone inside and out. Then, I'll map the "Problem -> Solution -> Process -> Results -> Lessons Learned" narrative onto the 10 slides, assigning a clear purpose to each one.

Next, I'll create a comprehensive design system that codifies everything learned from the research, including color rules, typography, icon styles, and layout principles. It needs to be super specific, so the presentation stays consistently on-brand. Accessibility is key here, so contrast ratios and color-blind-safe practices will be enforced.

Finally, I'm crafting detailed slide briefs for each of the 10 slides.  These briefs will be *extremely* specific, outlining the content, visuals, hierarchy, layout, colors, and rationale behind each slide. No room for ambiguity!  It needs to be a blueprint that anyone can follow to bring the presentation to life.

I'll then assemble everything into the requested format and, as a final check, make sure everything is in place to deliver a great presentation.  A good starting point for the next team and a high quality product.

## DESIGN SYSTEM

### Color Palette
- **Backgrounds:** White (#FFFFFF), Light Gray (#F4F5F7).
- **Text:** Dark Gray (#172B4D) for body, Atlassian Blue (#0052CC) for H1/H2 headlines.
- **Primary Brand:** Atlassian Blue (#0052CC).
- **Accents:** Teal (#00B8D9), Purple (#6554C0). Use for charts, icons, and callouts.
- **Semantic Colors:** Green (#36B37E) for success, Yellow (#FFAB00) for warnings/lessons.

### Typography Hierarchy
(Using Inter as the fallback font)
- **Display/Hero:** Inter Bold, 64-80pt, Title Case. Usage: Slide 1 title only.
- **H1:** Inter Bold, 40-48pt, Sentence case. Usage: Main slide headline.
- **H2:** Inter Semibold, 28-32pt, Sentence case. Usage: Sub-headlines or large callouts.
- **H3:** Inter Semibold, 20-24pt, Sentence case. Usage: Section headers within a slide.
- **Body:** Inter Regular, 16-18pt, Sentence case. Usage: Main paragraph text.
- **Captions:** Inter Regular, 12-14pt, Sentence case. Usage: Chart labels, image credits, footnotes.

### Icon System
- **Style:** Line icons, consistent with Atlassian's design system. Clean, slightly rounded corners.
- **Stroke Weight:** 2px.
- **Color Rules:** Use Atlassian Blue (#0052CC) or Dark Gray (#172B4D) for primary icons. Use Accents (Teal, Purple) for illustrative or categorical purposes.
- **Size Standards:** Small (24x24px), Medium (48x48px), Large (64x64px).

### Layout Principles
- **Grid:** 12-column grid.
- **Margins:** 60px on all sides (top, bottom, left, right).
- **Safe Zone:** All critical content (text, logos) must be within the margins. Full-bleed images are acceptable.
- **Whitespace Philosophy:** Target ~40-50% whitespace on average per slide. Use space to create focus and clarity.

### Color Usage Rules
- **Backgrounds:** Default to White (#FFFFFF). Use Light Gray (#F4F5F7) for slides with multiple cards or sections to create differentiation. Atlassian Blue (#0052CC) can be used for a full-bleed background on impact slides (e.g., Title, Quote, Thank You) but text must be white.
- **Text on Backgrounds:** Dark Gray (#172B4D) on White/Light Gray. White (#FFFFFF) on Atlassian Blue.
- **Accent Usage:** Use accents for no more than 10-15% of the visual elements on a slide. Use them to draw attention to key data, icons, or flow-chart connections.
- **Forbidden Combinations:** Do not place Yellow (#FFAB00) text on a white background (insufficient contrast). Do not use Green and Red together to avoid color blindness issues.

### Visual Style
- **Photography:** Authentic, diverse teams in genuine collaborative settings. Avoid staged stock photos. A subtle color overlay of Atlassian Blue at 10% opacity can be used to unify imagery.
- **Illustrations:** Use the Atlassian "blobby" but clean illustration style for conceptual diagrams. Focus on simplified shapes and brand colors.
- **Data Visualization:** Simple, clean charts. Bar charts, line charts, and large number callouts are preferred. Avoid 3D effects. Use the brand color palette, with Atlassian Blue as the primary data series.
- **Iconography:** Use icons to represent concepts quickly (e.g., a gear for "Process," a lightbulb for "Solution").

### Accessibility Standards
- **Contrast Requirements:** All text must meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- **Font Size Minimums:** Body text should not be smaller than 16pt.
- **Color Blindness:** Do not rely on color alone to convey information. Use labels, icons, and patterns in charts.

### Production Notes
- **Assets needed:** Atlassian logo files (SVG), Inter font files, a curated set of brand icons, approved photography.
- **File setup:** 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080 pixels), 150 DPI for raster images.
- **Software recommendations:** Figma, Google Slides, or PowerPoint.
- **Export specifications:** Final delivery as a PDF. Provide source file for future edits.
