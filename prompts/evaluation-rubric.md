# Evaluation Rubric for Slide Deck Design Specifications
### Universal Scoring System for Testing Prompt Quality

---

## Overview

This rubric provides a standardized way to score the quality of slide deck design specifications generated by the Gemini 2.5 Pro prompt. Each test output is scored across 5 dimensions, with a maximum score of 50 points.

**Passing Threshold:** 45/50 (90%)

This threshold was set based on the SolarWinds baseline output, which represents the quality standard we aim to match or exceed.

## Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Brand Research Quality (10 points)

Evaluates the depth and accuracy of brand research conducted.

**10 points - Excellent:**
- Exact brand colors found with hex codes (e.g., #F99D1C)
- Official typography identified with weights (e.g., Roboto Bold 700)
- Brand personality accurately described (3-5 specific adjectives)
- Recent brand updates noted (2023-2024 refreshes)
- Multiple sources cited (Brandfetch, official sites, design systems)
- For fictional companies: Sophisticated assumptions with competitor research

**7-9 points - Good:**
- Brand colors found but some hex codes approximate
- Typography identified but weights/sources incomplete
- Brand personality described but generic
- Some research sources cited
- For fictional companies: Reasonable assumptions documented

**4-6 points - Adequate:**
- Generic colors (e.g., "Nike uses black and white")
- Typography vague (e.g., "modern sans-serif")
- Brand personality missing or cliché
- Limited research evident
- For fictional companies: Weak assumptions, no rationale

**0-3 points - Poor:**
- Brand research clearly skipped or minimal
- No specific colors or fonts identified
- No sources cited
- For fictional companies: No assumptions made or inappropriate choices

**Evaluation Questions:**

## Interpreting Scores

### 48-50: Exceptional
Output meets or exceeds professional design agency standards. All specifications are complete, precise, and designer-ready. No significant gaps. Prompt is production-ready for this type of content/company.

### 45-47: Excellent
Output meets high-quality standards. Minor gaps or inconsistencies. Designer could execute with minimal clarifying questions. Prompt is near production-ready, minor refinements would improve.

### 40-44: Good (Below Threshold)
Output has useful content but significant gaps. Designer would need to ask multiple clarifying questions. Prompt needs notable improvements before production use.

### 30-39: Adequate (Needs Work)
Output provides basic direction but lacks critical details. Many specifications missing or vague. Prompt requires substantial revision.

### Below 30: Poor
Output does not meet minimum standards. Significant portions missing or unusable. Prompt requires major overhaul.

## Special Considerations by Test Type

### Tech Company (e.g., Atlassian)
- Expect strong brand research (mature companies have established guidelines)
- Professional, enterprise-appropriate aesthetic
- Data-driven visual hierarchy
- Should score well across all dimensions

### Consumer Brand (e.g., Nike)
- Expect bold, image-led designs
- Higher visual weight to photos (70-80%)
- Minimal text (5-8 words per slide)
- Emotional focal points
- Different hierarchy from B2B (not a weakness)

### Fictional Startup (e.g., CloudSync)
- Expect documented assumptions with rationale
- Industry research evident (competitors analyzed)
- Appropriate SaaS startup aesthetic
- Brand Research scored on assumption quality, not accuracy
- Should still score ≥45 despite no real brand

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Score Independently:** Evaluate each dimension before calculating total
2. **Use Checklist:** Go through all evaluation questions systematically
3. **Compare to Baseline:** Reference SolarWinds output for quality standard
4. **Document Evidence:** Note specific examples of strengths/weaknesses
5. **Be Consistent:** Use same standards across all test cases
6. **Focus on Actionability:** Identify specific prompt improvements needed

---

## Iteration Strategy

**If Score ≥ 45:** Prompt passes for this test case. Proceed to next test case.

**If Score < 45:** Identify 2-3 highest-impact improvements, refine prompt, and retest.

**Common Improvement Areas:**
- Brand research instructions not clear enough → Add more specific search queries
- Hierarchy inconsistent → Add more examples and clearer requirements
- Measurements vague → Add more "must include units" reminders
- Incomplete specs → Add "all slides must be complete" emphasis
- Design system thin → Add more detailed section requirements

**Goal:** Achieve ≥45 on all three test cases before considering prompt production-ready.
