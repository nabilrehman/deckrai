## Input for Technical/Informational Version

**Company:** solarwinds.com

**Presentation Type:** Technical deep-dive

**Audience:** Technical architects and data engineers

**Goal:** Educate on GCP data platform architecture and implementation details

**Content:**
We implemented a data lakehouse on BigQuery with the following architecture:

1. **Ingestion Layer (Bronze)**
   - Using CData Sync for real-time data ingestion from Salesforce and Pendo
   - Raw data stored in Bronze dataset with minimal transformation
   - Schema evolution handled programmatically via metadata tables

2. **Transformation Layer (Silver/Gold)**
   - DBT/Dataform for transformations
   - Domain-driven Silver layer organization
   - Business-ready Gold layer for analytics

3. **Governance & Security**
   - DataPlex for data taxonomy and discovery
   - Column-level security with policy tags
   - RBAC using Google Groups synchronized with Microsoft AD
   - Centralized custom roles at organization level

4. **AI & Analytics Integration**
   - BigQuery ML for in-database machine learning
   - Gemini Enterprise for code generation and analysis
   - Looker with LookML semantic layer for BI
   - Vector search capabilities for AI applications

5. **Cost Optimization**
   - Moving from on-demand to flat-rate BigQuery slots
   - Estimated commitment: 500 slots based on initial migration
   - Storage optimization with table partitioning and clustering

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- ELT over ETL (transform in BigQuery for performance)
- Separate non-prod and prod ingestion pipelines
- Governance team owns taxonomy, engineering applies tags
- Use of reservation assignments for workload isolation

## Expected Output Differences:

**Current (Status Report):**
- Timeline visuals
- High-level accomplishments
- Executive-friendly language
- Business metrics (500 licenses, etc.)

**Technical Version Would Have:**
- Architecture diagrams with components
- Code samples (SQL, DBT models)
- Technical specifications (slot sizes, table schemas)
- Implementation patterns and best practices
- Performance benchmarks
- Security implementation details
- More "How" than "What"

**Slide Examples for Technical Version:**
- Slide 3: "BigQuery Lakehouse Architecture" (detailed diagram with datasets, views, materialized views)
- Slide 4: "ELT Pipeline Implementation" (code walkthrough of CData → Bronze → Silver transformation)
- Slide 5: "DataPlex Taxonomy Structure" (hierarchical diagram of tags and policies)
- Slide 6: "RBAC Implementation Pattern" (Google Groups → Custom Roles → Dataset permissions flow)
- Slide 7: "Gemini Integration Patterns" (code examples of using Gemini for SQL generation)
